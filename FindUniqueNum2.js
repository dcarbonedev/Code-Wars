// Find the unique number

// There is an array with some numbers. All numbers are equal except for one. 
// Try to find it!

// findUniq([ 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1 ]) === 2
// findUniq([ 0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0 ]) === 0.55
// Itâ€™s guaranteed that array contains at least 3 numbers.

// The tests contain some very huge arrays, so think about performance.


//*********************//
// This solution has less lines of code and is less complex
// BUT it has to run through every item in (a possibly large) array
// with the reduce function which is less efficient
// SEE old solution below it's more code but more efficient?

    return count1 > count2 ? set[1] : set[0];
